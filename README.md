<!-- ### [Kaltura Capture Recording](https://mediaspace.minnstate.edu/media/Kaltura+Capture+recording+-+April+26th+2025%2C+11%3A11%3A10+pm/1_sp0j5ef9) -->

<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates the implementation of Network Address Translation (NAT) on a Cisco router to allow internal private network devices to access the public internet. The lab was created in Cisco Packet Tracer and showcases a typical enterprise scenario where internal hosts use private IP addresses that must be translated to a public IP for external communication. This project reflects the practical application of NAT in enterprise networks where IP translation is required to bridge private networks with public internet access.
